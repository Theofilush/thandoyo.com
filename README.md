👨‍💻 Hello, I’m Theofilus Handoyo! This is my personal website.

> Fullstack Developer | Blockchain Engineer | Tech Enthusiast

## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I graduated with a Bachelor’s degree in Informatics Engineering from Universitas Pembangunan Jaya, South Tangerang. Skilled in programming, analysis, and problem-solving. I have interests in administration, system design and programming, application documentation, data analysis, applying statistical concepts, software testing, and database management. I pursue roles in IT such as IT staff, IT support, IT consultant, web development, mobile development, and software development.

Previously, I worked as a software developer with 2+ years of experience building tech services, implementing the software development life cycle, and maintaining technical and functional documentation. I am an experienced API developer with over 2 years in the banking industry. In that role, I managed API development using Axway API Policy Management, collaborated with clients and banking teams, and supported API integration and troubleshooting. I also built an HR system for employee management using Node.js. Additionally, I gained experience in the Go programming language through completing the Enigma Camp 2.0 Full-Time Golang Immersive Program.

I also enjoy meeting new people and am eager to keep learning, which allows me to work both independently and as part of a team.
